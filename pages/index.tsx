                      As a Cybersecurity student, I'm actively seeking opportunities to
                      enhance my knowledge and gain practical experience in the field. In
                      addition to my studies, I have a passion for artistic expression and
                      enjoy drawing in my free time. Playing video games is another interest
                      of mine, which allows me to unwind and explore different virtual worlds.

                      I began my journey in IT back in 2013, where I started by learning basic
                      HTML and C++ from university books. Since then, I've relied on resources
                      like Google and YouTube to expand my knowledge and learn new programming
                      languages. In 2022, I transitioned into the fields of System
                      Administration and Cybersecurity, which have been incredibly enriching
                      experiences. I've been constantly learning and I'm eager to continue
                      growing in these areas. Currently, I'm in my second year of studying
                      Cybersecurity in college. Aside from my IT pursuits, I also find
                      enjoyment in VR gaming, and I proudly identify as a full-time furry.

                      In a constantly advancing technological world, ensuring the safety and
                      security of our data has become increasingly crucial. I am passionate
                      about contributing to the efforts that protect our valuable information.
                      Each day, we come across news about cybersecurity exploits being
                      discovered, and I aspire to be part of the community that proactively
                      prevents such incidents. This is particularly critical for businesses,
                      organizations, and individuals who rely on robust mitigation processes
                      to safeguard their systems.
